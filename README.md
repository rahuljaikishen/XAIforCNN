# XAI TECHNIQUES - LIME, CIE INSPIRATIONS, FEATURE EXPLAINER TECHNIQUES FOR VGG16 PRE TRAINED MODELS


## About the project

The project consists of two pages. The first page displays explanations of the VGG16 neural network classification result using LIME explainers, which is used in benchmarking. The second page displays explanations of custom developed explainers that are influenced by counterfactual explanations, as well as maps the pixel weights of the second last layer of theÂ VGG16 model to provide insights into the most contributing pixels for categorization.
